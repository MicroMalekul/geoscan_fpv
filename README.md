# arduino
  
  Arudino is a file that you need to upload in arduino(surprisingly) to make it convert serial signal from code to PPM signal for HF module

# pioneerPPM
  
  PioneerPPM is a library for python, so you can send signal to arduino which sending signal to HF module which sends signal to drone's reciever which makes drone fly :)
  
  PioneerPPM is a prototype so it doesn't work for now :(

# test
  
  Test is a temporary solution to solve tasks that we wanted to solve using pioneerPPM but using pioneer_sdk instead
